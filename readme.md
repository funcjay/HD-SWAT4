# SWAT 4 sound pack for Hideous Destructor
All sounds were (obviously) taken from SWAT 4, developed by Irrational Games and published by Sierra.

I do not own the copyright to SWAT 4 and I do not own these assets.\
Blah, blah, yadda yadda legal speak.

Download the latest master and dump whatever part you wanna use in your load order.

***
HD_SWAT4Snd - Weapons, footsteps, etc.\
HD_SWAT4Mus - Dynamic music tracks from the game. Requires [DoomDynMus](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=72207).\
Also included a track from the [Elite Force mod](https://www.moddb.com/mods/swat-elite-force) by eezstreet.\
Not every track was included, because some of them are *extremely* short and have very obvious loop points.
